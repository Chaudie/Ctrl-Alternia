# Ctrl-Alternia
##tumblr theme for ctrl-alternia.tumblr.com

The goal of Ctrl-Alternia is to give off the feel of a **dyspoian|8bit|Surreal Pop Punk** feel, from the POV of the **)(IC** herself.
The showcase fandom of this theme is [Homestuck/MSPA](mspaintadventures.com).

Some elements I think of when it comes to this dreamsite are **Tron**, **chiptune**, **8bit**, **retro gaming**, **text adventure games**, **school feeding**.

**note: I am using this to gather all of my scatterbrained notes on this 'dreamsite' I'm trying to make. This is my first project and I'm still new to gitub. Please treat me kindly.**
